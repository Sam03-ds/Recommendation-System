## Recommendation System
This project focuses on developing a content-based recommendation system to suggest articles to social network users, determining which posts are most relevant to them based on their interests. A microservice was developed using Fast API to provide top personalized recommendations for users. The system leverages a machine learning model (Can Boost) trained on user interaction data and content features. Recommendations are generated based on the similarity of post features and user preferences. The service integrates with a PostgreSQL database to fetch real-time data about users and posts.
